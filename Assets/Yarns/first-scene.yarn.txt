Player: I feel a million times better. Thanks Coach P. I'll keep that in mind.
Coach: Please get out of here. We are about to play a tournament.
Player: No problem. Now which way is the exit again...? I never liked tennis courts bcause there's only one or two ways out. And if someone chains the gate... then what?
Coach: Same way as you took in, son.
Player: If only I could remember...

Logan: Hey man. You're a little later than usual.
Player: Yeah, just a little. I love the smell of American Spirits in the morning.
Logan: Want one?
-> Sure
    Player: Sure. I never know how you can afford the expensive kind.
    Logan: Hard work. Bribery. Thievery. Pick one.
    -> Hard work
    -> Bribery
    -> Thievery
    Logan: Don't actually pick-- it's rhetorical dude.
    Player: right lol
-> Nah
    Player: I'm good.
    Logan: Oh. That's... weird.
    Player: Huh?
    Logan: It's nothing. You just... usually take it.
    Player: I guess?
Logan: You look like you slept outside. Where did you end up last night?
Player: Outside.
<< extinguish cigarette >>
Logan: You missed Mr. Ham-and-Cheese lecture us on some dead guy named John Cheetos?
Player: John Cheetos?
Logan: Yup. Some writer or something
Player: Cheever.
Logan: God bless you.
Player: No. You mean John Cheever.
Logan: Sure, man. You're the genius. Still on for the party tonight? You should probably go home and change first. Or you know, go to class smelling like Lou Reed...
-> Go home
    Player: Yeah, I'm gonna go home. I'd be useless in class anyway.
-> Go to class
    Player: I might as well go to class.
Logan: Wait, really?
Player: Yeah?
Logan: That's... it's just that you usually |GO HOME|.
<< pause and logan looks around >> 
Logan: This isn't how it's supposed to happen.
Player: What are you talking about, man.
Logan: Something's not right. Did I fuck something up?
Player: Logan. Are you okay? What are you talking about?
<< gun >> 
Logan: I guess we can try turning it off and on again.
Player: Woah, what the fuck.
Logan: Let's try this again.
