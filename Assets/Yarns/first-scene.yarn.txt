Player: I feel a million times better. Thanks Coach P. I'll keep that in mind.
Coach: Please get out of here. We are about to play a tournament.
Player: No problem. Now which way is the exit again...? I never liked tennis courts bcause there's only one or two ways out. And if someone chains the gate... then what?
Coach: Same way as you took in, son.
Player: If only I could remember...
